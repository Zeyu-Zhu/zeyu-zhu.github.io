I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn), majoring in AI. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyong Cao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/caoxiangyong/home) from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn) throughout my undergraduate years. I am currently applying for Ph.D. in Showlab, NUS.

My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning, and I'm now working on the topic of **3D Object Generation**. If you are interested in my research papers or have some business ideas want to share, feel free to contact me with **zeyuzhu2077@gmail.com**.
