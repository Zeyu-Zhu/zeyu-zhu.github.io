I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn), majoring in Artificial Intelligence from [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm#).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyong Cao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/caoxiangyong/home) from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn) during bachelor. And now I'm looking for a Phd position to carry my future research.

If you are interested in my research or have some business idea want to share, feel free to contact me! 
My email is zeyuzhu2077@gmail.com.
