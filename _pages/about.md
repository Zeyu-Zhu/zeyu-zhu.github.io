I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyong Cao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/caoxiangyong/home) from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn) throughout my undergraduate years.

I am currently seeking admission to the Ph.D. program at Showlab, NUS.

If you are interested in my research or have some business idea want to share, feel free to contact me! 
My email is zeyuzhu2077@gmail.com.
