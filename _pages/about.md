Iâ€˜m a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence from [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm#) and [Qian Xuesen Honor College](http://bjb.xjtu.edu.cn), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning and robotics. And now I'm taking an internship in [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn) at 3D Generation topic.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyong Cao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/caoxiangyong/home) from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn) and [Prof. Deyu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/dymeng/1) from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.xjtu.edu.cn) during bachelor. And now I'm looking for a Phd position to carry my future research.
